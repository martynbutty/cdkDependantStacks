# CDK TypeScript project example dependent stacks

This is an example CDK project using TypeScript to demonstrate dependent (or linked) stacks.

A dependent stack is where one stack creates something which is shared with another stack. CDK automatically manages 
the dependencies for you.

This code doesn't actually do anything useful. It's simply a demonstration of how dependent stacks can be coupled, and 
later decoupled.
